## Overview

The Origami Moving Cubes Drawing Designer merges art, mathematics, and web technology to create a unique creative tool. These mesmerizing transformations, where a 3D cube seemingly changes its appearance as it rotates, require precise design of the unfolded pattern.

I developed this application to make this fascinating art form accessible to everyone:

## Features

- Synchronized multi-canvas preview system shows real-time transformations
- Custom jog wheel interface enables precise frame-by-frame animation control
- Intuitive drawing tools with adjustable brush properties
- Multilingual support across seven languages
- Progressive Web App capabilities for offline use

## Impact

Featured by popular science communicator Steve Mould in his viral video on optical illusions, this project demonstrates how technical precision can enable artistic expression. The application transforms a complex mathematical challenge into an intuitive creative experience.

## Technical Implementation

The application is built with modern web technologies:

### Details

- React and Next.js for component architecture
- Canvas API for high-performance drawing
- TypeScript for type safety
- Tailwind CSS for responsive design
- Custom internationalization solution supporting static site generation

The three-state dark mode toggle supports system preference detection and user overrides, while touch input support makes the application fully functional on mobile devices.
